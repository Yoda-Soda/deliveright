# Deliveright

Website for a food delivery business

## Requirements

A simple web host would do the trick as no frameworks or special technologies have been used to build the site. It's a simple HTML and CSS site with a small JS script.

## Project Notes

A design has been consigned to be turned into a functional web site using HTML and CSS.

## Setup

All files will need to be moved into the root directory of the hosting server wherever it will be hosted.

A simple `git clone git@github.com:Yoda-Soda/deliveright.git` will pull the site to the required directory.

## Design Notes

The site has been designed and developed to be responsive.
